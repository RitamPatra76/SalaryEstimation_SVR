# SalaryEstimation_SVR

## Overview
This project implements a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to predict salaries based on position levels. The model is trained on a dataset that contains position levels and corresponding salaries.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Implementation of SVR with RBF kernel.
- Evaluation of model performance using RÂ² score.
- Visualizations of the predicted salaries against actual values.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run `SalaryEstimation_SVR.ipynb` in a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab.
